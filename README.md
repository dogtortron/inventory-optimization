# Executive Summary

The project aims to maximize profit for Metal Co. based on the company's weekly anticipated demand and production capacity. By using the Linear Programming method to solve this optimization problem and Pythonâ€™s PuLP as the programming tool to carry out the computational tasks, our consulting firm came up with the optimal production and inventory schedule for each day of the week. By following our recommendation, Metal Co. will gain a profit of $2,256,410, an increase of 12.8% compared to profit before the optimized schedule.
